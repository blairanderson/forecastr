# CURSOR RULE: Rails API and Migration Generation

1. Rails API Convention:
   - Always generate new Rails applications in API mode (e.g., using `rails new app_name --api`).
   - Ensure controllers derive from ActionController::API to maintain lightweight, API-only functionality.

2. Migration File Generation:
   - Never hard-code migration files.
   - Use Rails generator commands (e.g., `rails generate migration MigrationName`) to create migration files.
   - Allow Rails generators to manage timestamps, versioning, and proper structure within migrations.

3. Consistency & Best Practices:
   - Adhere to Rails conventions to maintain clarity and consistency across the codebase.
   - Regularly review generated code for adherence to API patterns and migration standards.
